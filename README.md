# IIIT-B Bike sharing Assignment using Linear Regression

## Problem Statement:

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

Essentially the company wants :

To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands
They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
